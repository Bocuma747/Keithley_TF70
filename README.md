# Keithley_TF70
 
A drop-in replacement PCB for the Keithley TF-70 resistor network found in Keithley 172A and 173A multimeters. This is R615 in Rev B instruments, as found in the A/D converter section of the service manual.

Bill of materials is located in BOM.csv. For maximum performance, I recommend 0.1% tolerance resistors with the lowest temperature coefficient available.
The header pins are generic right-angle header pins with 0.1" (2.54mm) pitch, the same as on breadboards.

The PCB can be ordered from any of the usual PCB fabs by uploading Gerber.zip. No special requirements should be necessary.
