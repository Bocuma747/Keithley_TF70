# Keithley_TF70
 
A drop-in replacement PCB for the Keithley TF-70 resistor network found in Keithley 172A and 173A multimeters.

Bill of materials is located in BOM.csv. For maximum performance, I recommend 0.1% tolerance resistors with the lowest temperature coefficient available.
The header pins are generic right-angle header pins with 0.1" (2.54mm) pitch, the same as on breadboards.



Original resistor network, exposed and labeled to show the inner resistors and pin numbers:
